# dna.py takes two .CSV files as input. One a database of people which contains the DNA sequence of the individual, and the other a random sequence of dna sample. the program takes the database and stores it as a dictionary data type in python. It then counts the number of STR (Short Tandem Repeats) in the sample DNA file, and compares the highest count with the stored database. If it is a match, the program outputs the name of the person it matches. Otherwise it returns no match.
