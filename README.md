# Houses contains two python scripts:
Import.py - Takes a csv file as a command line argument, cleans the data, and saves it in a SQLite3 table in a database.
Houses.py - Takes name of the house as a command line argument and runs a SQLite3 query on the database saved in import.py, returning the results in alphabetical order.
