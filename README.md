Welcome to the Global Mentoring Program Project overview.

1. Click on the Global Mentoring Program link above to view the code in python.

ABOUT:
The program was developed on Python 3.7.3 in order to automatically match over 200 FLPs with mentors across the globe based on timezone, preference, and department. 

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Takes two csv files as input using command line arguments.
2. Uses Pandas dataframes to store the information.
3. Matches each FLP with a mentor using a weighted average algorithm.
4. Outputs the matched list as a csv file.
